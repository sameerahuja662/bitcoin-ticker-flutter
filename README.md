# Crypto Coins
A Crypto Currency price checking app. Helps keep an eye on your crypto investments on the go.
Supports BTC, ETH and LTC prices into all major fiat currencies.

The objective of this project was to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.
Platform specific widgets in flutter help provide a native app like look and feel and allows to follow different design guidelines for different platforms.


## What i used in this project

- DropdownButton Widget from Material design for Android platform.
- Looping through lists in Dart for and for-in loops.
- Cupertino Widgets in your app for iOS platform.
- Check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
- Integration with coinAPI [https://docs.coinapi.io/#md-rest-api] for all Crypto values.
(I still have a free account with coinAPI, so API calls are still limited.)
